# SwiftUI_MVVM_TestProject

In this project we talk about MVVM (Model - View Model - Model), which is a design pattern recommend for SwiftUI 🤩. Next we will discover what MVVM means and how it works with SwiftUI. A important part is to understand the data flow. We will see why we use ObservableObject and @Published.
We will be focus on the declarative programming in SwiftUI, where "the truth" comes in. In the view part we will see the difference between @ObservedObject, @StateObject and @EnvironmentObject. 
 We will use it to improve a sample project and take advantage of it when working in the preview and writing unit tests.
